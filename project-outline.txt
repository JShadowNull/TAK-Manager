Phase 0: Package Configuration Setup
----------------------------------
Goal: Base configuration supporting development and packaging

Tasks:
1. Set up development with hot reload
2. Configure production builds for PyWebview
3. Create packaging configs for macOS/Windows
4. Implement proper path handling

Phase 1: Initial React Setup & Resource Management
-----------------------------------------------
Goal: React setup with proper resource handling

Tasks:
1. Add React dependencies and packaging tools
2. Configure Vite for packaged applications
3. Update PyWebview configuration
4. Set up environment configurations

Dependencies to Add:
- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- socket.io-client
- chart.js
- react-chartjs-2

Phase 2: Component Architecture
-----------------------------
Goal: Create platform-aware React components

Tasks:
1. Create base components with resource handling
2. Set up routing with packaging support
3. Convert shared components
4. Implement platform-specific behaviors

Components to Create:
- Layout
- Sidebar
- TitleBar
- Modal
- Button
- SearchBar

Phase 3: Socket.IO Integration
----------------------------
Goal: Cross-platform Socket.IO implementation

Tasks:
1. Create Socket.IO context
2. Implement connection management
3. Handle reconnection logic
4. Add platform-specific network handling

Phase 4: Page Migration
---------------------
Goal: Convert pages with platform awareness

Pages to Migrate:
1. Dashboard
   - System metrics
   - Charts
   - Resource monitoring

2. Services
   - Service monitoring
   - Platform-specific service management
   - Permission handling

3. Data Package
   - File system operations
   - Path management
   - Platform-specific file handling

4. Installers
   - Installation processes
   - Elevation handling
   - Platform-specific installations

Phase 5: Platform-Specific Builds
-------------------------------
Goal: Configure builds for each platform

macOS Configuration:
1. React packaging
2. Code signing
3. Permissions
4. Resource bundling

Windows Configuration:
1. React packaging
2. Windows-specific requirements
3. Permissions
4. Resource bundling

Phase 6: Testing & Verification
-----------------------------
Goal: Cross-platform testing and verification

Testing Areas:
1. Development Environment
   - Hot reload
   - Resource loading
   - API interactions

2. Packaged Applications
   - Resource accessibility
   - Permissions
   - Platform features

Build Commands
-------------
Development:
npm run dev

Production:
npm run build

Packaging:
npm run package:mac
npm run package:win

Important Considerations
-----------------------
1. Resource Management
   - Relative paths
   - Packaged resources
   - Permissions

2. Platform Differences
   - File system operations
   - Window management
   - System permissions
   - Installation processes

3. Security
   - Code signing
   - Resource verification
   - Permission handling

4. Performance
   - Resource bundling
   - Load time optimization
   - Memory management

Migration Strategy
----------------
1. Implement one phase at a time
2. Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
3. Maintain backwards compatibility
4. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
5. Keep both systems running until migration complete

Documentation Needs
-----------------
1. Setup instructions
2. Development workflow
3. Build processes
4. Packaging instructions
5. Platform-specific considerations
6. Troubleshooting guides

Version Control Strategy
----------------------
1. Create feature branches for each phase
2. Maintain separate branches for platform-specific code
3. Use pull requests for code review
4. Tag releases appropriately

Rollback Plan
------------
1. Maintain working versions of both systems
2. Document rollback procedures
3. Keep backup of critical configurations
4. Test rollback processes

Success Criteria
--------------
1. All features working in React
2. Successful packaging for both platforms
3. Performance matching or exceeding current app
4. Clean migration with no data loss
5. Complete documentation
