# Container Migration Instructions

## Context
- Application has been containerized from host machine deployment
- Container runs with privileged flag and docker socket access
- Additional volume mounts can be added via docker-compose if needed

## Requirements
1. Maintain existing function names and socket emit events
2. Remove OS detection logic since container provides consistent environment
3. Keep changes minimal to preserve app stability
4. Ensure cross-platform compatibility within container

## Implementation Notes
- Remove OS detector dependency and related code
- Container provides standardized environment, no need for OS-specific handling
- Preserve all current functionality and API contracts
- Focus on simple, non-breaking changes

## Testing
- Verify all existing functionality works in container
- Test socket communication
- Validate docker management features
- Ensure metrics collection works as expected
